# Stay Connected

Access to the internet and the *real* news.

## What in the hell is this?

**Stay Connected** is a bot that provides cracked vpn accounts (i hope its not against tos), VLESS, VMESS, ShadowSocks and many other ways to bypass the regime's internet limitations.

## How does it work?

The source code is easy to read. But trying to explain how tf does it work is hard to me. FOR GODS SAKE-

## Why?

Because of the current situation in Iran, It's been hard to access the internet, I mean, the GLOBAL internet. I felt that if I was lucky and somehow managed to connect (dont ask me how) It's a duty to help my compatriots and Iran's oppressed people who are testing a fuckton of proxies and vpns. Theres a lot of scammers and (sorry) mfs trying to make money out of this situation, and also the spywares dressed in vpns, etc. So I wrote this tiny bot, to simply give people a way to connect.

## How can I help?

You could host this bot somewhere, decentralization is bad. (I have to make an accessible database for the stuff but here u go).

You can add this bot to your server, maybe there was a persian member and it helped them. Who knows.

If you had any vpn accounts, servers or ways to fight this goddamn regime, simply send it via the bot, or contact me in discord, `rfwn#8866`. very cool username I know.

## I didn't mean that kind of help

Oh then, you can contribute to this project, no pr templates or any kind of these shit. Just fork this and send a pr.

## Why apache license?

cuz the name was cool.
